# Burger-Restaurant
Demonstrating MVC architecture with a full-stack web application combining Node, MySQL, ORM and Express.

This app presents you with a minimal interface for a burger restaurant.

When the user orders a new burger via the text field / submit button, it appears as Available.

If an available burger is DEVOURED, it moves to the column of burgers that have been devoured.

If the user chooses to EAT IT AGAIN, that burger moves back to the Available column.

These changes are reflected in real-time within a database, created and managed via MySQL and a manually-written ORM.

jQuery was used to capture values and incorporate them into our database.
